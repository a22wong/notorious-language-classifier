The Notorious Apple Pickers strike back as The Notorious Language Classifiers.

Below you will find an outline on how to run each of the classifiers:

Naive Bayes:
Open the Naive Bayes folder available
Open the "naive_bayes.py" python script
The code should run without problems, getting the data from the parent folder.
Should the data be located elsewhere, the user will have the change the directories in lines 10 through 12. 
The code will output one line containing the percentage of correct classifications for the training set.
The prediction csv will be output to the same folder the "naive_bayes.py" file is in.
The change the prediction csv between the testing and training set, simply change line 14, "current_prediction_set = testing_x" to "current_prediction_set = training_x"
